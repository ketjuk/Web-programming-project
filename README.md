Built a Flask backend with SQLite3 as database
According to the lab instructions, I have completed the following:

1.Using HTTP status codes and upgrading the feedback mechanism (2 points)

5.Applying Further Security Measures (3 points) : 
When I presented my work to Ayesha, I had implemented a symmetric encryption version with a shared secret key between the server and client.She advised me to replace it with asymmetric encryption, so I implemented RSA encryption, where the public key is stored on the server and the private key is stored on the client.

10.Deploy Your Solution on a PaaS (2 points) : 
I deployed my program on Elastic Beanstalk. 

12. Recover Your Password (2 points) : 
On the client.html page, entering an email address and clicking the "password?" button will trigger an email containing a randomly generated password.

I also refined my server.py to make it more well-documented.
